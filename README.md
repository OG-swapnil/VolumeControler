I have created a volume controler using hand gesture using python 
in this project I used 3 libraries:
>OpenCV->CV2
>Pyautogui
>mediapipe
used cv2 to access camera and take image as input
used mediapipe to locate hand movements and track them using dots
used pyautogui to get access to system volume controls
